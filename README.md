CHESS PROJECT

This repository contain my personal version of the game Chess. 
I implemented all and only the Official chess rules (en passant and castling included). There is no time constraint nor anyway to apply a time constraint.
The game is available in two different versions:
    
    (1) Chess_Project_CLI
        It is the game version that is usable only on terminal. 

    (2) Chess_project_GUI (WORK IN PROGRESS...)
        It is the game version that is usable only on display.
        This version uses the ImGui game engine.

Both version are programmed in C++ and you can find all the scripts and the external libraries used inside the respective folder.
I hope you like my games!
