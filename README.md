CHESS PROJECT

This repository contain my personal version of the game Chess. 
I implemented all and only the Official chess rules (en passant and castling included). There is no time constraint nor anyway to apply a time constraint.
The game is available in two different versions:
    
    (1) Chess_Project_CLI
        this version is playable only on terminal. 
        (some terminal may not support the colored texts... I have no idea how to fix it, i advice to change the code where i implement the color.hpp library -> all printing functions)

    (2) Chess_project_GUI (WORK IN PROGRESS...)
        this version is playable only on display using the ImGui game engine.

Both version are programmed in C++ and you can find all the scripts and the external libraries used inside the respective folder.
